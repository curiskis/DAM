# Further Data Manipulation

## Functions

Once we get deeper into writing R code for data manipulation, we soon come across the need to create user-defined functions.  We have been using many pre-built functions, such as `str()` and `summary()`, but we can also create our own functions for specific purposes.  In R, a function has the general syntax:
```{R function}
my_function = function(argument1, argument2) {
  statements
  return(something)
}
```
The function `my_function()` requires two arguments, does something (calculates an object called `something`), then returns `something`.  It is important to remember that objects created within the function will not be available in your general R environment unless they are returned.  The body of the function is defined within the curly brackets, {}.

Here is a simple example of a function that takes a number and returns the square of it:
```{R function1}
x_squared = function(x) {
  x_2 = x ^ 2
  return(x_2)
}
```
We can apply this function over a vector of numbers:
```{R function1_apply}
numbers = 1:10
x_squared(numbers)
```
We can also return multiple objects from a function.  For example, let's create a function that returns two summary statistics (a.k.a [moments of a distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(mathematics))), plus the number of rows:
```{R moments_function}
moments = function(x) {
  # the mean is the first moment of x
  mean = mean(x)
  # standard deviation is the second moment of x
  sd = sd(x)
  # number of rows is given by the length of the vector
  rows = length(x)
  # combine the three vectors into a data frame
  moments = data.frame(mean, sd, rows)
  return(moments)
}
# apply our function to some numbers
moments(numbers)
```


## Aggregation
Throughout the usual process of preparing data for analysis, we commonly need to do some aggregation.  This involves calculting some measures of numeric variables (or even counting rows), aggregating (or grouping) over some factors.  For those familiar with Excel, this is the same as using a pivot table.  In R we easily do this by using the __`aggregate()`__ function.  

Let's load the diamonds data set, which you can download from UTSOnline.  Again, to read a csv file in from disk, we can use either the `read.csv()` or `read.table()` functions as follows:
```{R read, eval=T}
data = read.csv("diamonds.csv", header = TRUE)
data = read.table("diamonds.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
```

We will start by calculating the average carat for each cut:
```{R aggregate}
aggregate(formula = carat ~ cut, data = data, FUN = mean)
```
The __`aggregate()`__ function requires three key arguments.  The first is __formula__, which we saw previously while doing some plotting.  This object comes up again and again in all sorts of R functions, most notably with models.  It's just a way to specify which variables we want to use, and in what way - you generally need to look up the documentation of the function to see how to specify the formula.  In the case of __`aggregate()`__, the variables we wish to be calculated are on the left of the tilda (~), while those on the right are grouping factors.  The second argument is just our data frame, and the last argument (ironically named as __`FUN`__) specifies how we want our measures to be calculated.  We can use any standard numeric aggregate function (e.g. mean, sd, sum), but can also specify our own functions.

The example above is very simple, so lets go a bit further.  We might wish to calculate the mean of several numeric variables.  To do this, we need to use the __`cbind()`__ function to collect them together, then pass this to the formula on the left of the tilda:
```{R aggregate2}
aggregate(formula = cbind(carat, depth, price, x, y, z) ~ cut, data = data, FUN = mean)
```
We might then wish to add another grouping variable, to see how the means vary over combinations of two variables.  In the formula, we simply use __+__ to add additional grouping variables.  Let's try it with __color__ and __clarity__.  We will also store the result in a data frame, `aggr`, and output the top 10 rows:
```{R aggregate3}
aggr = aggregate(formula = cbind(carat, depth, price, x, y, z) ~ cut + color + clarity, data = data, 
                 FUN = mean)
head(aggr, 10)
```
If we want to order our data frame by a variable, we can use the `order` function applied to the rows index in the data frame. The first argument is the variable name which we want to sort by, and the second argument is whether we want to sort by decreasing or not.  This is handy to remember. E.g., here are the top 6 rows of `aggr` in descending order by `carat`:
```{R order}
head(aggr[order(aggr$carat, decreasing = T), ])
```

Lastly, we can use any function we like for the aggregate numeric variable calculation, such as a function similar to the __`moments`__ function we defined earlier.  We have to modify the syntax slightly to comply with the `FUN` argument in `aggregate`. 
```{R aggregate4}
aggregate(formula = carat ~ cut, data = data, 
          FUN = function(x) { c(mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x), rows = length(x)) })
```
Note how R preserves the variable's name by adding the calculation name, `carat.mean`, `carat.sd` and `carat.rows`.  


# Advanced Data Visualisation

We covered some basic data visualisation last week using the built in `graphics` library.  Now we will look at some more advanced visualisation using `ggplot2` and interactive visualisations using `shiny`.

## qplot

ggplot can produce some very impressive visualisations in R, but it can be difficult to get a grips on the syntax.  It is based around the gramar of graphics.  Luckily, there is a lot of material online to help you through this (e.g. http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/).  We'll start by using the simplified __`qplot()`__ function (quickplot), which is designed to be a ggplot shortcut with syntax similar to `plot`.  To begin, we load `ggplot2` to memory.
```{R ggplot2_library}
library(ggplot2)
```
`qplot` requires three arguments as mandatory, which are the `x` value (your variable), your `data` set, and a `geom`.  This last argument stands for geometry, and is how we tell `qplot` what sort of plot we want.  Using the same diamonds data set as before, let's give it the `carat` variable and see what happens:
```{R qplot}
qplot(x = carat, data = data, geom = "auto")
```
Success! `qplot` has determined that since `carat` is a numeric variable, it should plot a histogram to show us the distribution.  Let's go a bit further and add a `fill` argument to the plot, passing the factor variable `clarity`.  This will create a stacked histogram:
```{R qplot2}
qplot(x = carat, data = data, geom = "auto", fill = clarity)
```
Instead of a histogram, we might want to plot a density distribution.  Think of this as a histogram with very narrow bins, and a smoothed curve.  Density plots tend to show more detail than a histogram, and it is generally easier to compare distributions split by a factor.  To create one, we just change the `geom` to be `"density"`. The last parameter, `alpha`, just species how transparent our filled colours are. 
```{R qplot3}
qplot(x = carat, data = data, geom = "density", fill = clarity, alpha = I(0.25))
```
Lastly, we might want to look at a scatter plot of `carat` against `price`, coloured by the `color`.  We can also add a chart title using the `main` argument.  Note that there are over 50,000 data points in this plot:
```{R qplot4}
qplot(x = carat, y = price, data = data, geom = "point", color = clarity,
      main = "Plot of Price against Carat by Color")
```

## ggplot

`qplot` is great for quickly producing many standard plots using `ggplot`, without knowing the full `ggplot` syntax.  Ultimately, if we want to add more customisation and details, we will need to use the core `ggplot` syntax.  It can be daunting at first, but learning the core concepts behind the syntax will help.  There is a wealth of material online, so don't fret about memorising everything!

Let's start with the core `ggplot` syntax.
```{R ggplot_syntax, eval=F}
ggplot(data, aes()) + geom()
```
There are three core elements to any `ggplot` graph.  The first is your data set. The second is the __aesthetics__, __`aes()`__.  This encodes what variables in your data set you wish to display, and where you wish to display them.  The third component is the __`geom()`__, the __geometry__.  The geometry defines the actual graphical elements displayed in the plot.

It's easier to understand with an example.  The `ggplot` code below reproduces the last `qplot` we created.  The `qplot` code is given for reference. 
```{R ggplot_qplot, eval = F}
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = clarity)) + geom_point()
# qplot code for reference
qplot(x = carat, y = price, data = data, geom = "point", color = clarity)
```
Both lines of code might look similar and definitely perform the same function.  However, it is very easy to extend the `ggplot` plot with additional geometries.  In the plot, it looks like there might be a difference in the relationship between `price` and `carat` for different `color` values.  We can determine if this is the case by overlaying trend lines.  We will overlay a trend line geometry using `geom_smooth`, letting R choose a method automatically.
```{R ggplot_qplot2, eval = T}
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = clarity)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "auto")
```
There is a very distinct line for `clarity = I1` which is much less steep then the others.  Judging from the plot, it might be worthwhile creating separate plots for each value of `clarity`.  This is known as 'faceting' the plot, and we can add the term `facet_wrap( ~ clarity)`.  The `wrap` part just tells R to wrap the individual plots over multiple rows to be readable. The argument, `~ clarity` tells R that we want to create separate plots for each value of `clarity`.  We can facet by additional variables by adding more into the expression.  While we're at it, we can also color the plot by `cut` to see visually if there is any clear effect from the cut type.  

```{R ggplot_qplot3, eval = T}
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) + 
  geom_point() + facet_wrap( ~ clarity) + geom_smooth(method = "auto")
```

Often while running `ggplot`, R will warn you about certain things.  These warnings are usually to do with a failure to produce everything you wanted.  While they are not severe enough to create an error and abort the code execution, certain features may not have been produced.  In this case, R warns us that `stat_smooth()` failed somewhere.  Looking at the plot, we can see that there are no smoothed lines for the `clarity` value `IF`.  

Overall, this visualisation is starting to make the relationship between price, carat and other variables more clear.  We'll leave it there with `ggplot`.  Mastering this library takes time and patience, and lots of google searches, but is well worth it in the end.

## Shiny

The last section in this exercise involves the `shiny` package.  `shiny` is produced by RStudio, who you should be familiar with by now! You should have a look at their website, which has some very simple examples of some `shiny` web applications.  https://shiny.rstudio.com/
